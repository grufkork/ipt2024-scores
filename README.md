# ipt2024-scores

This repo contains most scores from previous IPTs. The csv files contains a row for every judgement recorded during the physics fights, ready to be imported straight into Pandas. There's also the scraper itself, and a couple of scripts to run analysis.

### Fields:
- `juror`: The name of the juror who gave the score.
- `country`: The country/team which received the score.
- `fight`: The round of fights this score belongs to. 1-4 is selective fights, 5 is semis, 6 is grand final.
- `role`: The participants role.
- `problem`: The # and name of the problem presented.
- `round`: The round # within the fight (usually up to three)
- `fightName`: Plaintext title of the round
- `fightID`: All scores belonging to the same fight will have the same fightID.
