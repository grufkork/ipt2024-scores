# ipt2024-scores

This repo contains most scores from IPT 2024, scraped from [score.ipt.ee](https://score.ipt.ee/) 2024-04-06 10:00. The `data.csv` file contains a row for every judgement recorded during the physics fights, ready to be imported straight into Pandas. There's also the scraper itself, and a couple of scripts to run analysis.
